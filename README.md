# Number Guessing Game

Hi ! I have created a number guessing game for Python practice. Do check it out and upvote if you like it !!

This Number Guessing Game is a test of your luck and logic ! You can choose the difficulty of the game as you like, which changes the number of chances you get in each round.
Guess the number before the chances run out to WIN ! else its GAME OVER ! 
You can keep replaying the game for as long as you want, and set the difficulty individually for each round.
